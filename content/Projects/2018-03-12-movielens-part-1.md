I'm beginning a project on the [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) dataset to learn about collaborative filtering algorithms. This is Part 1 of this project, where I do an initial exploratory data analysis to see what the data looks like. The remainder of this post is straight out of a Jupyter Notebook file you can download [here](/notebooks/2018-03-11-movielens-initial-ratings-eda.ipynb). You can also see it [here](https://github.com/benlindsay/movielens-analysis/blob/master/notebooks/01_Initial_Ratings_EDA.ipynb) on GitHub.

I have most of the code collapsed in the boxes that say "Expand Code" so we can skip right to the visualizations, but all of the code is here if you expand the code blocks. Thanks to [Jake Vanderplas](http://vanderplas.com/) for the amazing [Pelican plugin](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/liquid_tags) that makes this possible.
